  1b. Write a function get_substitutions1, which takes a string list list (a list of list of strings, the substitutions)

  The result is all the full names you can produce by substituting for the first name (and only the first name) using
  substitutions and parts (b) or (c). The answer should begin with the original name (then have 0 or more other names).
  Example: similar_names([ ["Fred","Fredrick"],["Elizabeth","Betty"],["Freddie","Fred","F"] ], {first="Fred", middle="W", last="Smith"})
